They linger and grow at the peripheries, becoming old-hat to a tiny group while remaining nearly invisible to everyone else. Until someone names them.</strong></p><p>This may be the inevitable consequence of a standards-based process and unsynchronized browser releases. We couldn’t keep a new feature secret if we wanted to, but that doesn’t mean anyone will hear about it. XMLHTTPRequest was available broadly since IE 5 and in Gecko-based browsers from as early as 2000. “AJAX” happened 5 years later.</p><p>This eventual adding-up of new technologies changes how we build and deliver experiences. They succeed when bringing new capabilities while maintaining shared principles:</p><p>- URLs and links as the core organizing system: if you can’t link to it, it isn’t part of the web</p><p>- Markup and styling for accessibility, both to humans and search engines</p><p>- UI Richness and system capabilities provided as additions to a functional core</p><p>- Free to implement without permission or payment, which in practice means standards-based</p><p>Major evolutions of the web must be compatible with it culturally as well as technically.</p><p>Many platforms have attempted to make it possible to gain access to “exotic” capabilities while still allowing developers to build with the client-side technology of the web. In doing so they usually jettison one or more aspect of the shared value system. They aren’t bad — many are technically brilliant — but they aren’t of the web:</p><p>These are just the ones that spring to mind offhand. I’m sure there have been others; it’s a popular idea. They frequently give up linkability in return for “appiness”: to work offline, be on the home screen, access system APIs, and re-engage users they have required apps be packaged, distributed through stores, and downloaded entirely before being experienced.</p><p>Instead of clicking a link to access the content you’re looking for, these systems make stores the mediators of applications which in turn mediate and facilitate discovery for content. The hybridzation process generates applications which can no longer live in or with the assumptions of the web. How does one deploy to all of these stores all at once? Can one still keep a fast iteration pace? How does the need to package everything up-front change your assumptions and infrastructure? How does search indexing work? It’s a deep tradeoff that pits fast-iteration and linkability against offline and store discovery.</p></article></main></body></html>
